# plasticproject

This was a project created for my Information Visualisation module during my Postgraduate degree. We were told to find a data set focused on a topic of our choice. I decided to focus mine on plastic pollution and its effects on the planet and marine life. I found the research to be interesting and really enjoyed creating this project.
